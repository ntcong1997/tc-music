        "artistBio": "“I think there’s a time in every artist’s life [when] they have to do something that isn’t for fans, isn’t for success, isn’t for touring,” Miley Cyrus told Apple Music in 2018. Cyrus could’ve been speaking about any number of moments from her profoundly varied career. Born Destiny Hope Cyrus—the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus—in Tennessee in 1992, the innovative artist has hardly stayed in one lane for more than a single album since she broke from the bubblegum pop that catapulted her to stardom as Disney’s Hannah Montana. Her 2009 summer anthem “Party In the U.S.A.” earned her a rapid ascent within the pop world, where 2013’s <I>Bangerz</I>—which showcased her musical maturity with “Wrecking Ball” and experimented with elements of Dirty South hip-hop—made her an icon. Vocal about her pansexuality and love for marijuana, Cyrus has worked hard to shed her wholesome teen image, and simultaneously defied odds by earning a reputation for an intense work ethic and an unshakable self-assuredness. She headed to left-field with the psych-tinged 2015 album <I>Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz</I>, a collaboration with members of The Flaming Lips, and with 2017’s <I>Younger Now</I>, a countrified pop offering that featured godmother Dolly Parton. And she's teamed up with rappers Mike Will Made It and will.i.am, Sarah Barthel of electronic rock group Phantogram, and, in 2018, Mark Ronson for the dramatic hit single “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart.” Those frequent partnerships have been major catalysts in the creation of Cyrus' diverse catalog and in the cementing of her status as a pop pace-setter by refusing to let it, or herself, be easily defined.

That’s the premise of Disney’s <I>Hannah Montana</I> television series, and it succeeded beyond its creators’ wildest dreams, making a bona fide star of Miley Cyrus and launching an empire that encompassed four seasons of television, multiple chart-topping hits and albums, and a 2009 movie. The show, which debuted in March 2006, was helmed by Cyrus, who won the starring role at the tender age of 11, buoyed (despite her youth) by her preternaturally mature, husky singing voice and her undeniable acting chops. (Her real-life father, country star Billy Ray Cyrus, played her dad and agent in the show.) For all the show’s comedic shenanigans, each hit song it featured cemented Cyrus’s status as a talented singer who could ably straddle pop, rock, and country music, as heard in songs like the iconic “The Best of Both Worlds” and “He Could Be the One.” By the end of the third season, Cyrus began to feel she was outgrowing the format, and in the fourth season her character, Miley Stewart, reveals that she’s lived a double life, concluding the show’s narrative arc. The end of the family-friendly series enabled Cyrus to reinvent herself and pursue a more mature career that saw her ascend to the upper echelons of pop music—this time as her more outspoken, fearless, and unscripted self."

                "artistBio": "Demi Lovato rose to musical fame alongside the Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus, a new generation of Disney stars finding mainstream success on the pop charts. She forged her own path, though, thanks to powerhouse vocals, a balance of vulnerable ballads and club-ready bangers, and her advocacy for mental illness and addiction issues. Born in 1992 in Albuquerque and raised in Dallas by her mother, a former Cowboys cheerleader, Demetria Lovato hit it big with the 2008 movie <I>Camp Rock</I> and released her debut studio album, <I>Don't Forget</I>, the following year. That record was the first step on her ascension from teen star to global icon, a status she’d cement through hit singles, collaborations with artists like Christina Aguilera, Luis Fonsi and Timbaland, and a turn as a judge on <I>The X Factor</I>. Lovato’s discography has something for every playlist, like the warm-weather bop “Cool for the Summer”, the self-affirming anthem “Confident”, and the stunning heartbreaker “Anyone”, which she told Apple Music was, in retrospect, “a cry for help” about her struggles with substance abuse. Demi’s openness about her personal life and raw, honest songs like “Sober” made her even more beloved by fans worldwide, while 2020’s polished pop gem “I Love Me” and Sam Smith duet “I’m Ready” proved she’s a still-evolving star who continues to inspire and amaze.

                "artistBio": "Talking to Apple Music in early 2020, Selena Gomez said the point when her career really started to shift was when she shot the 2012 movie <i>Spring Breakers</i>. Even if she hadn’t spent the first part of her life as a Disney kid, the movie—guns, drugs, so on—would’ve been the kind of deep-end leap that pop stars tend to be conditioned away from. Selena Gomez is famous. But she’s also a survivor of fame, a candid chronicler of mental health whose best music—“Lose You to Love Me,” “Back to You,” Dance Again”—has brought a degree of frankness to mainstream pop that feels both refreshing and necessary. “I think that’s how I’ve continued to have a career,” Gomez said. “I’m very okay with speaking about myself. I think that’s truly what has sustained me. And I don’t do it purposefully, I do it because it’s necessary for me.”<br>\nBorn in 1992, Gomez grew up poor outside Dallas, making her way into the Disney machine in her mid-teens, becoming the most-followed—and probably most-scrutinized—person on Instagram by her early twenties. She started releasing music with her band The Scene in 2009, going solo in 2013 with <I>Stars Dance</I>. By 2015’s <I>Revival</I>, she’d taken greater control over both her image and songwriting, leaning into a comfortable dance-pop sound that didn’t chase trends. In 2020, she released <I>Rare</I>, an album on which she not only cowrote every track but served as executive producer. She’d also taken a two-year break from social media—a career risk, but a personal necessity. “I was so much happier with just me, myself, how I looked, and that helped a lot,” Gomez told Apple Music. “I just needed to let my old self go.”"

                "artistBio": "Armed with a mesmerizing, nimble soprano—and a vocal register often likened to Mariah Carey’s and Christina Aguilera’s—Ariana Grande began her career as a child star on Broadway and Nickelodeon before transforming into a pop and R&B powerhouse. Instantly recognizable thanks to her signature ponytail, cat ears, babydoll dresses, and breezy self-confidence, her slyly sexual personal brand has, like that of the Spice Girls before her, become an iconic image of young female power. But Grande is more than a symbol: Over the course of several albums and scores of hit singles—beginning with 2013’s “The Way” (featuring Mac Miler) through The Weeknd-assisted “Love Me Harder” and “Break Free” (featuring Zedd)—she has consistently outshined her male collaborators and deftly parlayed her stardom into activism. An LGBTQ advocate and outspoken feminist (“I’m tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man’s past, present, or future PROPERTY,” she tweeted in 2016), she uses her platform to confront issues like misogyny, sexism, homophobia, and bullying, spreading a message of love over all. Nowhere was this more clear than in May 2017: After terrorists attacked her concert in Manchester, England, killing 22 and injuring hundreds, Grande continued her tour. \"Perspective changes your life,” she told Beats 1’s Ebro Darden. \"You want to stay in the moment and try not to give into fear, because obviously the whole point of finishing the tour was being there for my fans. You want to set the same example and keep going.” And that she did: Her Max Martin-produced smash “No Tears Left to Cry,” an escapist dance-floor triumph released a year after the attack, sends a message of hope and healing, with a dose of hear-me-roar attitude.

                "artistBio": "She’s the dream girl. The free spirit. The candy-coated pinup and the well of inner strength. She’s a little Disney, a little Betty Boop. But she’s also an avatar for the modern female pop star in a post-Madonna world—the liberated woman who kicks open doors without knocking. Under all the sparkle and glitter, you could sense an artist grappling with messy human contradictions—about sexuality, about self-love, about asserting femininity in a man’s world. Talking to Apple Music in 2019, Katy Perry said she leads with her gut and lets her mind follow, and doesn’t make much sense of any of it until the work is done. “The themes are joy,” she said. “They are empowerment. They are trying to expand the boundaries of what I think, and trying to learn from all this opportunity.” She might actually be a superhero. But she also might just be what she is: a girl from Southern California who worked like crazy and didn’t flinch.<br>\nBorn in 1984 to Pentecostal pastors in Santa Barbara, Perry (originally Katy Hudson) grew up on gospel music, putting out her first album, 2001’s <I>Katy Hudson</I>, on a Christian label. At some point during adolescence, she discovered Queen, a band whose mix of flamboyance, power, and sexualized wit cracked her creative world open. (Perry named her fragrance Killer Queen, after one of the band’s signature songs.) Club tracks, ballads, classic pop-rock, and contemporary electronic music—Perry’s production collaborators are brilliant (Dr. Luke, Max Martin, benny blanco), but it's her songwriting, her image, her balance of playfulness and confidence that pull the package together. And for every “Teenage Dream” or “I Kissed a Girl,” there's a “Firework” or a “Roar,” music that turns expressions of vulnerability into anthems of inclusion and self-renewal—a dynamic that has made Perry an inspirational figure not only to young women, but for an LGBTQ community she vocally supports.<br>\nPerry doesn’t quite know how she went so platinum—2010’s <I>Teenage Dream</I> reached commercial heights previously set only by Michael Jackson—but while the numbers are nice, the work is what's important. “It’s up to me to make the right choice in my mind to keep putting one foot in front of the other and going forward,” Perry told Apple Music. “Not going backwards—I could easily go backwards by literally looking at a photo. But I have to go forward, because I know what’s good for me now.”"

                "artistBio": "The country world feigned surprise when, after three albums of Music Row-indebted songcraft, Taylor Swift formally embraced pop on 2012’s Red. But no one should have been shocked: Any 14-year-old capable of persuading her parents to move from suburban Pennsylvania to Nashville for her career clearly has ambition to burn. And the thrill of following Swift’s rise has been watching her execute it flawlessly, largely because her melodic intelligence is equal to that ambition. Her early, youthful love songs heralded 2010's newly self-possessed <i>Speak Now</i>—which showed off her scathing wit—and evolved into knowing, ironclad pop fare that held its own against boisterous Max Martin production on <i>1989</i>, her fifth album, titled after her birth year. Throughout, her songwriting has blurred the lines between the public and private, burying enough real-life clues (about, say, scarves and Starbucks) to make clear that only Swift can own her narrative, thank you very much, while still retaining a lyrical elegance. Though 2017’s <i>reputation</i> might have been perceived as a gorgeously constructed piece of dramatic theater—its attendant heroes and villains all real-life characters from Swift's public feuds—all that spectacle proved an attention-grabbing cover for her most romantic album yet. She turned up the romance even more on 2019’s <i>Lover</i>, but it was 2020’s <i>folklore</i> and its companion, <i>evermore</i>—ruminative, relatively lo-fi albums written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic—that earned her the Apple Music Award for Songwriter of the Year."

                "artistBio": "Some may dismiss pop as inauthentic. But for Lady Gaga—one of popular culture’s greatest, most extravagant creations—the inauthenticity is the point. No artist has more defiantly embodied that provocation this century than the one born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (in New York in 1986). Never wedded to the same image—one minute wearing a dress made of raw meat at the MTV VMAs, the next a coat of Kermit the Frog puppets on German TV—Gaga personifies pop’s surface obsessions while simultaneously upending them.<br>\nIn a sense, her creative identity had crystallized by age 21, having been a child pianist, aspiring actor, and burlesque performer. Each of these facets powered her career’s most distinct parts: the celebrity fascination of her first two albums, 2008’s <i>The Fame</i> and 2009’s <i>The Fame Monster</i>; the subversive layering of 2011’s <i>Born This Way</i> and 2013’s <i>ARTPOP</i>; the sincere reverence of 2014’s <i>Cheek to Cheek</i>, her jazz standards album with Tony Bennett; and the rootsier songwriting of 2016’s <i>Joanne</i>. If 2009’s “Paparazzi” reveled in the flashes, then “Born This Way” celebrated inner light: In translating her diffuse identity into world-conquering art, Gaga has become a beacon to anyone else who’s felt like an outsider. Her loyal following—a.k.a. Little Monsters—has affirmed a deep connection to her message of self-love and self-expression, despite pop’s fickleness and her chameleonic exterior. She played out a simpler version of her path to fame in the 2018 remake of <i>A Star Is Born</i>: But while her character’s ascent was abetted by her lover, Gaga’s was all her own."

                "artistBio": "In the late 2000s, social media gave misfits and outsiders the means to carve out their own personal space online, and attract legions of followers by presenting the most raw and unfiltered version of themselves. And no artist personified that moment quite like Kesha Rose Sebert (born 1987), the brash, potty-mouthed, nose-ringed anti-diva who crashed the Top 40 through her wailing cameo on Flo Rida’s 2009 synth-rap chart-topper, “Right Round,” and then stuck around like she owned the place. At a time when EDM-infused maximalism was reshaping the sound of pop music, Kesha united club kids, hip-hop heads, and indie hipsters under one festival tent through bratty bops like “TiK ToK” and “We R Who We R.” And she was also the rare omnivorous pop star who was just as eager to record Stooges tributes with psych-pop kings The Flaming Lips (“2012 [You Must Be Upgraded]”) as hook up with dance-rap pooh-bah Pitbull for his 2013 strobe-lit smash “Timber.” Behind the scenes, however, Kesha’s life was no party—a struggle with eating disorders and a nasty legal battle with her former producer, Dr. Luke, brought her career to a halt. By the time Kesha resurfaced with 2017’s <i>Rainbow</i>, she was being celebrated as an icon of the burgeoning #MeToo movement, and the album’s spirit of empowerment and emancipation filtered down to its non-conformist sound, which foregrounded the country, soul, and classic-rock influences she inherited from her musician mother, Pebe (who also guested on the record). And 2020’s <i>High Road</i> found her reclaiming the more sexualized persona of her earlier work, while doubling down on her reputation as pop’s most unpredictable polymath—who else could trade verses with NOLA bounce deity Big Freedia, collaborate with Grimes, and harmonize with Brian Wilson and Sturgill Simpson on the same record? “I’m not going to let something that happened to me in my past define who I’m going to be the rest of my life,” Kesha told Apple Music. “This record is me being like, ‘No—you’re not going to stick me in some box.’”"

                "artistBio": "Talking to Apple Music in early 2020, Selena Gomez said the point when her career really started to shift was when she shot the 2012 movie <i>Spring Breakers</i>. Even if she hadn’t spent the first part of her life as a Disney kid, the movie—guns, drugs, so on—would’ve been the kind of deep-end leap that pop stars tend to be conditioned away from. Selena Gomez is famous. But she’s also a survivor of fame, a candid chronicler of mental health whose best music—“Lose You to Love Me,” “Back to You,” Dance Again”—has brought a degree of frankness to mainstream pop that feels both refreshing and necessary. “I think that’s how I’ve continued to have a career,” Gomez said. “I’m very okay with speaking about myself. I think that’s truly what has sustained me. And I don’t do it purposefully, I do it because it’s necessary for me.”<br>\nBorn in 1992, Gomez grew up poor outside Dallas, making her way into the Disney machine in her mid-teens, becoming the most-followed—and probably most-scrutinized—person on Instagram by her early twenties. She started releasing music with her band The Scene in 2009, going solo in 2013 with <I>Stars Dance</I>. By 2015’s <I>Revival</I>, she’d taken greater control over both her image and songwriting, leaning into a comfortable dance-pop sound that didn’t chase trends. In 2020, she released <I>Rare</I>, an album on which she not only cowrote every track but served as executive producer. She’d also taken a two-year break from social media—a career risk, but a personal necessity. “I was so much happier with just me, myself, how I looked, and that helped a lot,” Gomez told Apple Music. “I just needed to let my old self go.”"

                "artistBio": "There’s purpose in Dua Lipa’s euphoric pop. “For me, it’s about championing women and putting ourselves in the position of power,” the singer told Apple Music in 2020, ahead of the release of her second album, <i>Future Nostalgia</i>. “I have been inspired by the female alphas that have shown me that we can do it. And that we can wear the pants, you know? We need more of that in music.” Forcing the world to get a little more comfortable with female alphas has been a mission statement for Lipa (born in London to Kosovar Albanian parents in 1995) since her 2017 self-titled debut. It housed the triumphant breakup smash “New Rules,” the self-love anthem “IDGAF,” and the assured “Hotter Than Hell”—songs which made it clear that this was no ingénue, but rather an outspoken, effortlessly cool face of pop’s future. Indeed, that status was cemented a year later when Lipa made history as the first female solo artist to receive five BRIT Award nominations. She won two and, in 2019, added two Grammys to her mantelpiece.<br>\nDespite the success of her debut, Lipa wasn’t interested in recreating its hits. “People always say, ‘The second album is really scary,’ but for me, it’s more scary to go back into the studio and try to create something like ‘New Rules’ or ‘IDGAF’ over and over again,” she said. “I feel like I’d end up in a vicious cycle of trying to get somewhere but never being able to mature as an artist.” And so, to move forward, she pivoted to the past, drawing on disco and funk—and filtering it through her ahead-of-its-time pop—to arrive at <I>Future Nostalgia</I>. Decadent and every bit as empowering as those early hits, it brought Lipa her first Mercury Prize nod, multiple Grammy nominations, and a rightful place in pop’s upper echelons. And with it, too, came Lipa’s new purpose. Released just as the world went into lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis, <I>Future Nostalgia</I> became an urgent tonic for tough times—danced to in living rooms across the world. Yet Lipa wasn’t done there: Five months later, she unveiled <I>Club Future Nostalgia</I>, a thrilling remixed version on which the singer teamed up with club queen The Blessed Madonna, and guests including Madonna, Missy Elliott, Gwen Stefani, and Mark Ronson, to bring lockdown-fatigued listeners another dose of escapism. “I didn’t think I’d be putting albums out during a global pandemic,” added Lipa. “But it’s just about creating experiences for everyone at home. That’s the most important thing for me now.”<br>\nAll of this, of course, is only just the beginning. “I really feel like I’m finding my feet,” said Lipa. “I feel so proud of <I>Future Nostalgia</I> as a whole and the most confident and the most myself making it. But I’m already planning the next move.”"

Every night before I go to sleep, I say goodbye to myself, in a way, because that person is done.” The shape-shifting pop icon has worn many hats throughout her action-packed career—Disney idol, pop/rap dynamo, down-home hippie torn between Nashville and Malibu—but there’s something about her rock-star chapter, realized in her glamorous seventh album <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, that feels the most like her destiny.<br />\nIt isn’t just that Cyrus has the pipes to carry these pummeling, heavyweight songs, which funnel '80s glam and punk into anthemic, electric pop—it’s how downright convincing she is in the role. Rock’s leading ladies are on board: After Cyrus turned Blondie’s “Heart of Glass” into a raw, rough-edged revelation, Debbie Harry called her a “force to be reckoned with.” On “Bad Karma,” Joan Jett brings “I don’t give a damn” attitude to a song that raises a glass to bad decisions. And Nicks, clearly a major influence, bellows magnificently on the remix to “Midnight Sky,” a tantalizing riff on “Edge of Seventeen” that feels like a woman set free.<br />\nMuch of the album was shaped by Cyrus’ divorce from actor Liam Hemsworth, which was finalized in early 2020, as well as the loss of her house in a California wildfire and her struggles with addiction. But on <i>Plastic Hearts</i>, she channels all that real pain, guilt, and suffering—and occasionally, the jaded frustration of someone who’s been up and down before—into glossy yet vigorous expressions of inner tension and heat. “I have the artist torture thing going on, too, where I’m a little conflict-seeking because it’s creative,” she says. “I like to feel sad sometimes. And I like to feel happy. I really like to <i>feel</i>. It’s inspiring to me.”",

Everything changes me forever. Every night before I go to sleep, I say goodbye to myself, in a way, because that person is done.” To celebrate the release of her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts, the shape-shifting global pop icon opened up to Zane about the many forces that have shaped her life and recent music: addiction, karma, family, peace, fear, divorce, and Joan Jett. She felt particularly inspired by the latter while writing her ’80s-inspired LP, which features Jett and Billy Idol and finds Miley channeling her inner Debbie Harry. “When she created Blondie, that was like creating a drag character,” she says, explaining the power of an alter ego to transform and inspire creativity. “When you’re writing a song, you can go anywhere in your imagination.”",
